Introduction:

Role

Most important thing in the world is communication. Your job is to make communication between users and the company you work at better. Once a developer ships stuff out into the world, mot often they just go back to coding and not worrying about it, becuase it's "done". Software is a constant feedback loop, and the clearer you show that connection the better. That is the business value and power you have. Wth data, input and endless comments from users you can push change in the product.

Support

There are three things you can help a person with.

- Short term


- Long term 

-- Feature change

-- Automate Support / Analysis

As tempting as this sounds to be the catch all solution, this isn't always the best option. 


-- Process change




Scripts
- Helpers
- Analysis: Graphs, visualizing data
- CRUD apps for support / pjm

Most of all, try to make your scripts, your app, or whatever it is, useful to the outside world. Open Source it. This helps absolutely everyone. It helps promote yourself by showing your skills, or at least the fact that you care to share your little project. It helps promote the company by showing they are willing to share technology and solutions to share with the world. It helps your fellow emplyees and customers should other people start contributing to your code.
