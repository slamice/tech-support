So [as Joel Spolsky reminds us](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/customerservice.html), you can fix problems two ways. However there is a secret third way to fix problems which is infinitely more awesome and much much harder to do.

Support agents, specifically tech support people, understand better than anyone how the system works and where their pain points are.

There are of course some preconditions to this working:
- Backing it all up with real data.
- Having the flexibility to work to changing/simplifying the feature.

Working towards simplifying teh feature is always better. Less people have to look at it, it's easier to debug.


What if the pain points didn't exist in the first place?

e.g. We had a localization product called String.

1. We built String to help people localize technical content

2. While focusing on otehr aspects of Gengo, we support string people

http://blog.gengo.com/string-shut-down/

3. Working on other parts of teh site, that's a pain

4. We removed String for many reasons

5. -=(Poof)=- All problems and issues are gone!





Summary: It's really important to push product changes. As a tech support engineer you have access to user opinions and code, so you can make an educated decision back up with user data. This saves everyone time in the long run.
