Most important thing in the world is communication. Your job is to make communication between users and the company you work at better. Once a developer ships stuff out into the world, mot often they just go back to coding and not worrying about it, becuase it's "done". Software is a constant feedback loop, and the clearer you show that connection the better. That is the business value and power you have. Wth data, input and endless comments from users you can push change in the product.
